A website for my family to share all of our favorite recipes.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and update `REACT_APP_COOKBOOK_SERVER_URL` with your Cookbook server URL.

3. Run the app in development mode

   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8888/

## Building for production

A minified production build can be generated for deployment:

npm run build
